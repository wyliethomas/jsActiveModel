jsActiveModel
=========
jsActiveModel is intended to be a model layer for javascript frameworks that saves model data locally to the Web SQL database and will also sync offline data with an api.


Status
------------
All of the local storage is currently using the Web SQL Database. With the recent announcement of the W3C abandoning Web SQL for indexedDB, I intend to add/replace the new standard into the project as soon as it is available.


For best results
------------
The framework in the examples are created using the [Kubari](https://github.com/Reisender/Kubari) framework. It's the best JS framework for my purposes. I would like to see what could be done with other frameworks.
